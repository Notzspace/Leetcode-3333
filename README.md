## Problem Statement

Alice is attempting to type a specific string on her computer, but she is clumsy and may press a key for too long, resulting in a character being typed multiple times. Given a string `word` representing the final output on Alice's screen and a positive integer `k`, determine the total number of possible original strings Alice might have intended to type, where the original string has a length of at least `k`. Since the answer may be large, return it modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Constraints
- \(1 \leq \text{word.length} \leq 5 \times 10^5\)
- `word` consists only of lowercase English letters.
- \(1 \leq k \leq 2000\)

### Examples
1. **Input**: `word = "aabbccdd"`, `k = 7`  
   **Output**: `5`  
   **Explanation**: Possible strings are "aabbccdd", "aabbccd", "aabbcdd", "aabccdd", "abbccdd".

2. **Input**: `word = "aabbccdd"`, `k = 8`  
   **Output**: `1`  
   **Explanation**: Only "aabbccdd" is possible.

3. **Input**: `word = "aaabbb"`, `k = 3`  
   **Output**: `8`  
   **Explanation**: Various combinations of 1 to 3 'a's and 1 to 3 'b's summing to at least 3 characters yield 8 ways.

## Approach

The problem requires counting the number of possible original strings that could produce the given `word` by repeating characters, with the constraint that the original string has at least `k` characters. The provided solution uses a dynamic programming (DP) approach with inclusion-exclusion to efficiently compute the result.

1. **Group Consecutive Characters (Runs)**:
   - Scan the input string `word` to group consecutive identical characters into "runs".
   - Store the length of each run in a list `freq`. For example, "aabbccdd" results in `freq = [2, 2, 2, 2]` (two 'a's, two 'b's, two 'c's, two 'd's).
   - Each run of length \(l\) can contribute \(r\) characters to the original string, where \(1 \leq r \leq l\).

2. **Initial Total Ways**:
   - Compute the total number of possible original strings without the length constraint by multiplying the run lengths (\(l\)), as each run can contribute any number from 1 to \(l\) characters.
   - For example, for `freq = [2, 2, 2, 2]`, total ways = \(2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 = 16\).
   - Apply modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to avoid overflow.

3. **Feasibility Check**:
   - If the number of runs (\(\text{len(freq)}\)) is at least `k`, return the total ways, as the minimum length of the original string (one character per run) is at least `k`.

4. **Dynamic Programming with Inclusion-Exclusion**:
   - If \(\text{len(freq)} < k\), some original strings have fewer than `k` characters. Use inclusion-exclusion to subtract the number of strings with length less than `k`.
   - Define:
     - \(f[j]\): Number of ways to form a string of length \(j\) using the first \(i\) runs (processed up to the current iteration).
     - \(g[j]\): Cumulative number of ways to form a string of length up to \(j\) using the first \(i\) runs (\(g[j] = \sum_{m=0}^j f[m]\)).
   - For each run \(i\) with length \(freq[i]\):
     - Update \(f[j]\) for length \(j\): Include strings of length \(j-1\) from the previous runs (\(g[j-1]\)) and exclude those where the current run contributes more than \(freq[i]\) characters (\(g[j - freq[i] - 1]\)).
     - Update \(g[j]\) as the cumulative sum of \(f[j]\).
   - After processing all runs, \(g[k-1]\) gives the number of strings with length less than `k`.
   - Final answer: Total ways minus \(g[k-1]\), modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

5. **Modular Arithmetic**:
   - All arithmetic operations are performed modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to handle large numbers.

## Formulas

- **Total Ways Without Length Constraint**:
  \[
  \text{Total} = \prod_{i} \text{freq}[i]
  \]
  where \(\text{freq}[i]\) is the length of the \(i\)-th run.

- **Inclusion-Exclusion for Strings of Length < \(k\)**:
  - Let \(f_i(j)\) be the number of ways to form a string of length \(j\) using the first \(i\) runs.
  - For run \(i\) with length \(freq[i]\):
    \[
    f_i(j) = g_{i-1}(j-1) - g_{i-1}(j - \text{freq}[i] - 1) \quad (\text{if } j - \text{freq}[i] - 1 \geq 0)
    \]
    where \(g_{i-1}(j) = \sum_{m=0}^j f_{i-1}(m)\).
  - Final answer:
    \[
    \text{Total} - g_m(k-1) \mod 10^9 + 7
    \]
    where \(m = \text{len(freq)}\).

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**:
  - **Run Grouping**: \(O(n)\), where \(n = \text{word.length}\), as we scan the string once to compute `freq`.
  - **Initial Total Ways**: \(O(m)\), where \(m = \text{len(freq)} \leq n\), for multiplying run lengths.
  - **DP Loop**: For each run (up to \(m\)), iterate over lengths \(j = 0\) to \(k-1\). Each iteration performs \(O(1)\) operations.
  - Total: \(O(n + m \cdot k)\), where \(m \leq n\) and \(k \leq 2000\). Since \(n \leq 5 \times 10^5\), this is efficient enough.

- **Space Complexity**:
  - \(O(k)\) for the DP arrays `f` and `g`, as they store values for lengths up to \(k-1\).
  - \(O(m)\) for the `freq` array, where \(m \leq n\).
  - Total: \(O(k + m)\), which is \(O(k)\) since \(m \leq n\) and \(k \leq 2000\).
